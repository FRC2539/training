/* This program will help students learn about prime factorization */

/*
 * When this program is started, the user will be shown a randomly selected
 * number between 2 and 100. The student must state rather the number is prime
 * or composite. When the student has answered, the program will determine
 * whether the student was correct. If the number was composite, the program
 * will display the prime factorization of the number.
 *
 * This will repeat until the student chooses to finish, at which point the
 * program will print out how many correct and incorrect answers there were, and
 * then exit.
